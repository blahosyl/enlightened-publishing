                <b>The Early-Career Workshop</b>
              </p>
                <p>
                The challenges are particularly demanding for early-career researchers. They will soon be writing their next grant application or looking for their next job. How can they use the current system to further their careers?
              </p>
           <p>   
                The Early Career Workshop is a three-hour workshop for them.

                <b>The Supervisor's Workshop</b>
              </p>
              
              <p>  
                Can universities be better at helping their PhD candidates and postdocs make good decisions about publishing? Are our mid- and senior-level researchers up-to-date on the requirements of local, national and international policies that affect them and their advisees?
              </p>
<p>
</p>
The Supervisor Workshop is a one-hour workshop targeting those who supervise early-career researchers.

                <li>key policies and their consequences, including Plan S, DORA, rights retention strategies and preregistration of research,</li>
                <li>what the most common bibliometric tools are (impact factor, citation indices, etc.) and how they affect publishing and career advancement,</li>
                <li>the difference between a high-quality journal and a high-quality article,</li>

          <h3>Prof. Curt Rice</h3>
          <h4>Making universities better</h4>
          <p>  Universities are essential for the betterment of society. My commitment to that belief motivates me and gives focus to my work, whether it is at specific institutions, in (inter)national organizations, or through my speaking and writing.</p>

      <!-- client's relevant experience -->
      <h3>My journey so far</h3>
      <p>
        I’ve been passionate about PhD education since I was a PhD candidate myself. The thrill of learning how to do research&mdash;how to discover new knowledge&mdash;and then how to contribute to an academic field by publishing or teaching that work is what motivated me to choose a career in academia.
      </p>
      <p>
        Along the way, I realized that creating the conditions for others to do excellent research is at least as important as doing it oneself. Because of that, I have spent most of the last 25 years in leadership positions, in addition to being a professor. Through all of these positions, I have been enthusiastically engaged in debates, policy-making and mentoring about academic publishing.
