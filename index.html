                Last year, over 5 million articles were published in academic journals!
                How can anyone make their work stand out in such a deluge of discoveries? How will others in your global research community find your results?

                The challenge is even greater for early-career researchers. Their network is limited. They are trying to position themselves and their work, and many of them will soon be looking for a job. This workshop is for them.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, any problem that early-career researchers have is also a problem for their supervisors and universities. Are you helping your PhD candidates and postdocs make good decisions about publishing? Do they understand the policies around article submission – such as open access, Plan S, licensing, pre-approval – and what that means for their careers? Do they understand how the choices they make deeply affect the findability of their work?

                With 25 years of supervision and university leadership experience, I have developed a workshop that will enable your graduate students and postdocs to understand:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>how open access publishing best supports the needs of researchers,</li>

                <li>how to avoid personally paying the OA publishing fees,</li>
                <li>exactly what Plan S is and what it means for them,</li>
                <li>the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA) and how it affects researchers’ careers around the globe,</li>
                <li>the advantages of “preregistering” research with journals,</li>
                <li>how “CC” licences work and when they should be used,</li>
                <li>what the most common bibliometric tools are (impact factor, citation indices, etc.) and how do they affect publishing,</li>
                <li>how our system for publishing actually affects what research gets done,</li>
                <li>what the ideal role for the major publishing houses in a well-functioning system for academic publishing would be.</li>

                Success for early-career researchers is also success for their research groups and institutions. That means that this workshop is good for their universities, too. The right approach to publishing will help PhD candidates finish their degrees, get their next grants and continue with important contributions to their chosen field.

          <h3>Prof. Curt Rice</h3>
          <h4>Making universities better</h4>
          <p>  Universities are essential for the betterment of society. My commitment to that belief is what motivates me and gives focus to my work, whether it is at specific institutions or in (inter)national organizations or through my speaking and writing.</p>

      <!-- client's relevant experience -->
      <h3>My journey so far</h3>
      <p>
        I’ve been passionate about PhD education since I was a PhD candidate myself. The thrill of learning how to do research – how to discover new knowledge! – and then how to contribute to an academic field by publishing or teaching that work is what motivated me to choose a career in academia.
      </p>
      <p>
        Along the way, I decided that working to create the conditions for others to do excellent research and education is just as important as doing it oneself and following that conclusion, I have spent most of the last 20 years in various leadership positions at universities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through all of these positions, I have been enthusiastically engaged in discussions and debates about publishing, ranging from Open Access to DORA to licensing, and more.
